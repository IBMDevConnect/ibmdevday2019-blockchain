# Mini Code Labs 1 - Try out Hyperledger Fabric with Java/Node SDK

Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions. The Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric, the software implementation of blockchain IBM is committed to, is a permissioned network. Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions underpinned by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency, flexibility and scalability.

In a Blockchain solution, the Blockchain network works as a back-end with an application front-end to communicate with the network using a SDK. To set up the communication between front-end and back-end, Hyperledger Fabric community offers a number of SDKs for a wide variety of programming languages. In this tutorial, we will talk about Fabric Java SDK.

It would be helpful for the developers, who started to look into Hyperledger Fabric platform and would like to use Fabric Java SDK and Node SDK for their projects. The SDK helps facilitate Java and Node applications to manage the lifecycle of Hyperledger channels and user chaincode. The SDK also provides a means to execute user chaincode, query blocks and transactions on the channel, and monitor events on the channel.

Hyperledger fabric network can be provisioned in different ways. Local setup, IBM Blockahain Platform starter plan and IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0.

This guide provides instructions to use Java and Node client using SDKs to connect to Hyperledger Fabric network provisioned in different ways as mentioned above. Refer to this [link](https://github.com/muralidharchavan/sdk-mini-code-labs) for more details.

# Mini Code Labs 2 - Try Out the IBM Blockchain Platform

IBM® Blockchain Platform provides a managed and full stack blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) offering that allows you to deploy blockchain components in environments of your choice. The environment can be IBM Cloud, on-premises through IBM Cloud Private, and third-party clouds, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). In this tutorial, we'll take you through the general process to set up a basic blockchain network with IBM Blockchain Platform.
