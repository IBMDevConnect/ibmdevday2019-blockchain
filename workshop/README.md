# Implement asset securitization on a blockchain ledger

Securitization is a financial process that can be used to consolidate a set of illiquid assets into a set of tradable securities. A common example of an illiquid asset would be a home mortgage, as one cannot be readily bought and sold. An example of a tradable asset is a stock or bond. This process can be useful for financial institutions that are looking to increase the liquidity of their assets and free up capital. This app leverages the IBM Blockchain Platform Starter Plan and provides a dashboard that allows users to create and view the relationship among assets, pools, investors, and securities.
